# CEO Check - Laird Superfood

## Scan Attempt

**Date**: Just now  
**Target**: lairdsuperfood.com / @lairdsuperfood  
**Scan ID**: scan_1765161076060_4fzs23c4d  
**Status**: ❌ **FAILED - API QUOTA EXCEEDED**

---

## What Worked ✅

**Scraping was successful** - Got data from all platforms:
- ✅ Twitter: 2,477 chars scraped
- ✅ YouTube: 7,898 chars scraped  
- ✅ LinkedIn: 519 chars scraped
- ✅ Instagram: 117 chars scraped

**Total scraped**: ~11,000 characters of content

---

## What Failed ❌

**LLM Extraction Failed** - API quota exceeded:
- Error: `429 Too Many Requests`
- Quota: `20 requests/day` (free tier limit)
- Model: `gemini-2.5-flash`
- Status: Quota exceeded

The scraping found plenty of content, but couldn't extract/analyze it due to API limits.

---

## CEO Verdict

**❌ CANNOT COMPLETE CHECK**

**Reason**: API quota exceeded - need to wait for quota reset or add more API keys.

**What We Know**:
- ✅ Scraping works - found content on all 4 platforms
- ✅ Content is available (11K chars scraped)
- ❌ Cannot analyze due to API limits

---

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for quota reset** (24 hours) OR
2. **Add more API keys** to rotation
3. **Re-run scan** once quota available

---

## Expected Results (Once Quota Available)

Based on successful scraping, should get:
- ✅ 5+ posts (from 11K chars of scraped content)
- ✅ 50+ char bio (from profile data)
- ✅ 3+ themes (from content analysis)
- ✅ 3+ strategic insights
- ✅ 3+ competitors
- ✅ Brand DNA extracted

**Confidence**: High - scraping found substantial content.

---

## Recommendation

**Wait 16 seconds** (as suggested by API) and retry, OR add more API keys to handle quota limits.

**Status**: Blocked by API quota, not by data availability.
