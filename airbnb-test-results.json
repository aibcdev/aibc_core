To help change that, we launched the Akiya Design Project with the Japan Kominka Association and cultural icons Kiko Mizuhara and Rola. Together, we restored traditional kominka homes in Kyoto and Ibaraki, transforming them into spaces where travelers can experience authentic Japanese culture firsthand. This project isn’t just about beautiful design. It's about reviving rural tourism, preserving cultural heritage, and supporting local communities. These kominka may be off the beaten path, but their deep history and sense of place make them destinations in their own right. A reminder that sometimes, the most meaningful travel experiences lie far from the familiar.",
