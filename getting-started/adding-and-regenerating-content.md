# Adding and Regenerating Content

AIBC automatically generates content based on your Content Plan, but you can also add one-off content or regenerate existing content with new angles and approaches.

Sometimes you need content outside your regular Content Plan—for special events, timely topics, or specific campaigns.

### When to Add Content Manually

- **Special events**: Product launches, webinars, announcements
- **Timely topics**: Responding to industry news or trends

## Regenerating Content

Regenerating creates a new version of content with a different angle, approach, or style while keeping the same topic.

### When to Regenerate

- **Content doesn't match your voice**: Regenerate to get better voice matching
- **Wrong angle**: Try a different perspective or approach
- **Needs improvement**: Content is close but needs refinement
- **Testing variations**: Try different styles or formats
- **Better brief**: You have more specific requirements now

### How to Regenerate

**Single Content Regeneration:**

1. Go to **Content Hub**
2. Find the content you want to regenerate
3. Click the content to open details
4. Click **"Regenerate"** button
5. **Provide a better brief:**
   - **New angle**: Different perspective or approach
   - **Audience focus**: Who this is specifically for
   - **Point of view**: Your stance or opinion
   - **Proof points**: Data, examples, case studies
   - **CTA**: Specific call-to-action
6. Click **"Regenerate"**

**Bulk Regeneration:**

1. In **Content Hub**, select multiple content items (checkboxes)
2. Click **"Bulk Actions"** → **"Regenerate"**
3. **Set regeneration parameters:**
   - Apply same brief to all, or
   - Regenerate each with its current brief
4. Click **"Regenerate Selected"**

### Regeneration Options

**Regenerate with better brief:**
- Provide more context
- Specify angle or approach
- Add proof points or examples
- Define target audience

**Regenerate with different style:**
- Change tone (professional → conversational)
- Adjust length (short → long)
- Switch format (post → thread)

**Regenerate for different platform:**
- Adapt content for another platform
- Adjust for platform-specific requirements
- Optimize for platform audience

## Best Practices for Regeneration

### Provide Better Briefs

**Instead of:** "Try again"

**Do this:**
- "Regenerate with a data-driven angle, include statistics about [topic]"
- "Make this more conversational, target small business owners"
- "Add proof points: case study from [company], include metrics"
- "Focus on [specific benefit], use [tone], target [audience]"

### Be Specific

**Good briefs include:**
- **Audience**: Who this is for specifically
- **Point of view**: Your stance or opinion
- **Proof points**: Data, examples, case studies
- **CTA**: Specific call-to-action
- **Tone**: Desired tone or style
- **Key points**: Must-cover points

### Iterate Strategically

1. **First regeneration**: Fix major issues (voice, angle)
2. **Second regeneration**: Refine details (tone, examples)
3. **Third regeneration**: Polish (word choice, structure)

**Don't regenerate endlessly**—if content isn't improving, consider:
- Updating your Brand Kit
- Adding better source materials
- Refining voice settings
- Using the Improve Feature

## Editing vs. Regenerating

### When to Edit

- Content is 80%+ there, just needs tweaks
- Specific words or phrases to change
- Minor adjustments to structure
- Adding your own examples or data

### When to Regenerate

- Content doesn't match your voice at all
- Wrong angle or approach entirely
- Needs different format or style
- Major structural changes needed

**Best practice:** Edit when close, regenerate when far off.

## Regeneration and Credits

**Credit costs:**
- Regenerating content uses credits
- Cost depends on content type and length
- Check credit balance before bulk regenerating
- See credit costs in Production Room

**Credit-efficient regeneration:**
- Regenerate one at a time to test
- Use better briefs to reduce iterations
- Edit when possible instead of regenerating

## Using the Improve Feature
