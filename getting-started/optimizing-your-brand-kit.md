# Optimizing Your Brand Kit (AIBC)

Your Brand Kit is the control center that keeps content on-brand and non-generic. It's where AIBC learns everything about your brand: who you are, how you communicate, what you stand for, and what content you want to create.

## What is the Brand Kit?

The Brand Kit (accessible via **Brand Assets** in your navigation) contains six main sections:

1. **Source Materials** - Documents, websites, and text the agent should learn from
2. **Media Library** - Your brand images, videos, and visual assets
3. **Profile** - Business information, audience, products/services, differentiators
4. **Styles** - Colors, fonts, and visual identity
5. **Voice** - Tone, style, vocabulary, do's and don'ts
6. **Preferences** - Content preferences, CTA style, hashtag rules, topics to avoid

## Accessing Your Brand Kit

1. Navigate to **Brand Assets** in the left sidebar (or go to `/brandassets`)
2. You'll see six tabs at the top: Materials, Media, Profile, Styles, Voice, Preferences
