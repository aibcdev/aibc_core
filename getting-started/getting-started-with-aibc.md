# Getting Started with AIBC

AIBC (AI Brand Content) is an autonomous content generation platform that researches, drafts, and optimizes content automatically using AI agents—so your traffic can grow "on autopilot." AIBC analyzes your brand's digital footprint to understand your voice, style, and messaging, then generates content that authentically matches how you talk, write, and post.

## What AIBC Does

AIBC is built to:

- **Generate content automatically** that matches your authentic brand voice
- **Schedule and publish** content across connected platforms
- **Track performance** and optimize content based on analytics
- **Manage your content pipeline** from ideation to publication

## Step-by-Step: Your First Setup

### 2. Run Your Brand Scan

The Brand Scan is the foundation of AIBC. It analyzes your digital footprint to understand your brand's authentic voice and style.

**What the Brand Scan does:**

**To run a Brand Scan:**
1. Navigate to **Dashboard** → Click **"Start Brand Scan"** or go to **Scan** page
2. Enter your website URL or social media username
3. Select platforms to scan (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, YouTube)

   - **Standard Scan** (Free/Pro/Business): LLM-powered web scanning, ~$0.10-0.50 per scan
   - **Deep Scan** (Premium only): Official API access with 10-year history, ~$7.00 per scan
5. Click **"Scan Digital Footprint"**
6. Wait for scan to complete (typically under 24 hours for standard scans)

**During the scan:**

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Content Feels Generic

**Problem:** Generated content doesn't sound like your brand.

**Solutions:**

3. **Run a deeper Brand Scan** if you have Premium tier
   - Deep scans use official APIs for more comprehensive data

### Content is "Off-Topic"

**Problem:** Generated content doesn't match your topics or industry.

**Solutions:**
