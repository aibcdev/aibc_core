# Implementation Plan - Dashboard & Content Hub Fixes

## Status: In Progress

### ✅ Completed
1. **Company Name at Top** - Made more prominent in dashboard header
2. **TikTok Added** - Added to scan stages in AuditView

### 🔄 In Progress
3. **Content Hub Unique Content** - Already has brand-specific filtering, need to verify uniqueness
4. **Strategy Chat** - Already processes user comments, need to ensure it dynamically updates content

### 📋 Remaining Tasks

#### High Priority
- **Production Room Credit Management** - Verify credit costs match pricing page (15/150/600)
- **Calendar Integration** - Ensure content is added to calendar and competitor content updates
- **Analytics Page** - Replace dummy data with real calculations
- **Tasks → Calendar** - Allow typing tasks that update calendar

#### Medium Priority  
- **Gemini API for Banner/Poster Creation** - Add image generation UI similar to Blaze AI
- **Brand Assets Page** - Clean up UI to match attached design

## Notes
- TikTok already in backend default platforms
- Strategy chat already has API integration for dynamic updates
- Content Hub has brand-specific filtering but may need uniqueness verification
