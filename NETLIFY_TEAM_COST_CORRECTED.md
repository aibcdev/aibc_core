## Alternative: Site-Specific Collaborators

Some features might allow **site-specific** collaborators (not full team members):
1. Go to a **specific site**
2. **Site settings** → **Access control**
3. Add collaborator email
4. They get access to **that site only**

**Note:** This might still require Pro plan - check Netlify's current documentation.
