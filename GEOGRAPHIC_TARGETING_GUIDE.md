## Common Location Targeting Mistakes

1. **❌ Targeting too broadly** - "People searching for your targeted locations" includes tourists
2. **❌ Excluding too early** - Wait for at least 100 clicks before excluding
3. **❌ Ignoring time zones** - Schedule ads for business hours in each location
4. **❌ Same bids everywhere** - Adjust bids based on location performance
5. **❌ No localization** - Consider localized ads for non-English markets
6. **❌ Ignoring currency** - Show prices in local currency when possible
