## If You Don't See "Team" Option

### Possible Reasons:

2. **UI has changed:**
   - Netlify updates their interface
   - Try the direct URL method

3. **Account type:**
   - Personal accounts vs Team accounts work differently
   - You might need to upgrade to see team features

## Alternative: Site-Specific Collaborators

Even on free tier, you might be able to:

1. **Go to a specific site**
2. **Site settings** → **"Access control"** or **"Team"**
3. **Add collaborator by email**
4. They get access to that specific site only

This might work even on free tier for individual sites.
