# ✅ Everything is Working!

## Your Setup:

- ✅ **Backend:** Running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ **Frontend:** Running on http://localhost:3003

## 🎯 Open This URL:

```
http://localhost:3003
```

## Test It:

1. Open http://localhost:3003 in your browser
2. Click **"Get Started"**
3. Enter a username (e.g., `elonmusk`)
4. Click **"Scan Digital Footprint"**
5. Watch it work!

## Why Port 3003?

Vite automatically chose port 3003 because 5173 was in use. This is normal and fine!

---

## Both Servers Running:

- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:3001 (API)
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:3003 (Website)

**Keep both terminals open!**

---

## Quick Test:

Test backend:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

Should return: `{"status":"ok",...}`

---

## Ready to Go! 🚀

Just open http://localhost:3003 and start using it!
