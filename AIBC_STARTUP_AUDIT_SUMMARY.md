## Conclusion

Startups show significantly higher receptivity to AIBC compared to Fortune 500 companies (78.4/100 vs. 53.1/100). The primary differentiator is that startups are more willing to adopt new tools if they solve specific problems, even if they're not fully enterprise-ready.

**Key Takeaway:** AIBC is well-positioned for startup adoption, but needs to prioritize platform integrations and developer tools to capture this market segment effectively.

**Strategic Recommendation:** Focus on building integrations with the tools startups use most (OpenAI, Notion, Linear, Figma) to capture this highly receptive market segment before pursuing enterprise features.
