2026-02-15T15:21:52.288487 [WARNING ] From version 0.5.0 onwards, Cognee will run with multi-user access control mode set to on by default. Data isolation between different users and datasets will be enforced and data created before multi-user access control mode was turned on won't be accessible by default. To disable multi-user access control mode and regain access to old data set the environment variable ENABLE_BACKEND_ACCESS_CONTROL to false before starting Cognee. For more information, please refer to the Cognee documentation. [cognee.shared.logging_utils]
