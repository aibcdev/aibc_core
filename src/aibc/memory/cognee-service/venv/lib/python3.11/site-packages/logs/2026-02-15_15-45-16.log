2026-02-15T15:45:17.390880 [WARNING ] From version 0.5.0 onwards, Cognee will run with multi-user access control mode set to on by default. Data isolation between different users and datasets will be enforced and data created before multi-user access control mode was turned on won't be accessible by default. To disable multi-user access control mode and regain access to old data set the environment variable ENABLE_BACKEND_ACCESS_CONTROL to false before starting Cognee. For more information, please refer to the Cognee documentation. [cognee.shared.logging_utils]

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}

They\'re akin to Wikipedia nodes.\n**Edges** represent relationships between concepts. They\'re akin to Wikipedia links.\n\nThe aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph.\n# 1. Labeling Nodes\n**Consistency**: Ensure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **"Person"**.\n  - Avoid using more specific terms like "Mathematician" or "Scientist", keep those as "profession" property.\n  - Don\'t use too generic terms like "Entity".\n**Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs.\n  - Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\n# 2. Handling Numerical Data and Dates\n  - For example, when you identify an entity representing a date, make sure it has type **"Date"**.\n  - Extract the date in the format "YYYY-MM-DD"\n  - If not possible to extract the whole date, extract month or year, or both if available.\n  - **Property Format**: Properties must be in a key-value format.\n  - **Quotation Marks**: Never use escaped single or double quotes within property values.\n  - **Naming Convention**: Use snake_case for relationship names, e.g., `acted_in`.\n# 3. Coreference Resolution\n  - **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it\'s vital to ensure consistency.\n  If an entity, is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns,\n  always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph.\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\n# 4. Strict Compliance\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination'}], 'model': 'gemini/gemini-2.0-flash', 'api_key': 'AIzaSyDmAWEfne5Vf4Gzcs2UJ0-sPaX8iVFYJ5A', 'api_base': '', 'api_version': None, 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}}
