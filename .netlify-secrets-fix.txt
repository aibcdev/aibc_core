URGENT FIX FOR NETLIFY SECRETS SCANNER

The netlify.toml file sets SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_ENABLED = false,
but Netlify may require this to be set as an ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE instead.

DO THIS NOW:

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Go to: Site settings → Environment variables
4. Check if SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_ENABLED exists
   - If it exists: Make sure value is "false" (not false without quotes)
   - If it doesn't exist: Add it with value "false"
5. Go to: Deploys → Trigger deploy → Clear cache and deploy site

ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION:

If the above doesn't work, you need to add your Supabase anon key to the omit list:

1. Go to: Site settings → Environment variables
2. Add: SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_OMIT_VALUES
3. Value: Your full Supabase anon key (starts with eyJ...)
4. Save and redeploy

The anon key is safe to expose - it's a public client-side key.
