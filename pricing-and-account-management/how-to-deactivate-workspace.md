# How to deactivate your workspace (Irreversible)

Deactivating your workspace permanently deletes all workspace data, content, and connected accounts. This action cannot be undone.

## ⚠️ Warning: This Action is Irreversible

**Before deactivating, understand:**
- **All data is deleted**: Content, Brand Kit, scans, analytics
- **Connected accounts are disconnected**: All integrations removed
- **Cannot be undone**: No way to recover deleted data
- **Export first**: Download your data before deactivating

## When to Deactivate

**Consider deactivating if:**
- You're closing the business/brand
- You no longer need the workspace
- You're consolidating workspaces
- You want a fresh start

**Consider alternatives:**
- **Downgrade plan**: Keep workspace, reduce costs
- **Cancel subscription**: Keep data, stop paying
- **Export data**: Save everything, then deactivate
- **Contact support**: Discuss options before deactivating

## Before Deactivating: Export Your Data

### What to Export

**Important data to save:**
- **Brand Kit**: Source materials, voice settings, preferences
- **Content**: All generated and published content
- **Analytics**: Performance data and reports
- **Scan results**: Brand DNA and insights
- **Integrations**: List of connected platforms
- **Settings**: Configuration and preferences

### How to Export

1. Go to **Settings** → **Data & Privacy** section
2. Find **"Export Data"** section
3. Click **"Export All Data"**
4. Select what to include:
   - Brand Kit data
   - Content library
   - Analytics data
   - Scan results
   - Settings

## How to Deactivate

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Export your data first** (see above)
2. Go to **Settings** → **Data & Privacy** section
3. Scroll to **"Danger Zone"** or **"Account Deletion"**
4. Find **"Deactivate Workspace"** option
5. **Read all warnings carefully**
6. Enter your password to confirm
7. Type workspace name to confirm (if required)
8. Check confirmation checkbox
9. Click **"Deactivate Workspace"** or **"Delete Workspace"**

### Confirmation Steps

**You may be asked to:**
- Enter password
- Type workspace name
- Check multiple confirmation boxes
- Answer security questions

**This is intentional** to prevent accidental deletion.

## What Gets Deleted

### Connected Accounts

**Disconnected:**

**What's kept (if applicable):**

### Downgrade to Free

**If you want to reduce costs:**
1. Downgrade to Free tier
2. Keep workspace and data
3. Limited features but data preserved
4. Can upgrade again later

### Archive Workspace

## Best Practices

### Before Deactivating

1. **Export all data** - Don't skip this step
2. **Verify export** - Make sure you have everything
3. **Download exports** - Save to secure location
4. **Disconnect integrations** - Revoke access on platform side (optional)
5. **Cancel subscriptions** - If applicable
6. **Contact support** - If unsure about anything

### Data Backup

**Create backups:**
- Export data regularly (even if not deactivating)
- Keep exports in secure location
- Multiple backup locations
- Test that exports work

## Common Questions

### Can I recover data after deactivation?

**No.** Deactivation is permanent. Export data before deactivating.

### What if I change my mind?

**Too late.** Once deactivated, cannot be undone. Export first, deactivate later if still needed.

### Can I deactivate just one workspace?

**Yes.** If you have multiple workspaces, you can deactivate one while keeping others.

### Will my account be deleted?

**Depends.** If this is your only workspace, account may be deactivated. If you have other workspaces, account remains.
