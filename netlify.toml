# Configure secrets scanning to ignore Supabase anon keys (which are meant to be public)
# Supabase anon keys are client-side keys that are safe to expose
[build.environment]
  # Disable smart detection for Supabase anon keys (they start with "eyJ" and are JWT tokens)
  # These are intentionally public client-side keys
  SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_ENABLED = "true"
  
# Note: To completely disable secrets scanning (not recommended), you would set:
# SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_ENABLED = "false"
# 
# However, we want to keep scanning enabled but ignore Supabase anon keys.
# The anon key pattern is: eyJ... (JWT token format)
# 
# Since Netlify doesn't support pattern-based exclusions in netlify.toml,
# we need to set SECRETS_SCAN_SMART_DETECTION_OMIT_VALUES in Netlify dashboard
# with the actual Supabase anon key value.
