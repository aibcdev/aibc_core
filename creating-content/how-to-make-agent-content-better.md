# How to make your Agent content better

The AIBC Agent learns from your Brand Kit and improves over time. Here's how to make your agent generate consistently better content.

## Understanding How the Agent Learns

**The Agent learns from:**

- **Brand Profile**: Business info, audience, differentiators
- **Voice Settings**: Tone, style, vocabulary, do's/don'ts
- **Your Edits**: When you edit content, the agent learns
- **Your Feedback**: Approvals, rejections, improvements

**The more you teach it, the better it gets.**

## Do This First: Add Source Materials
