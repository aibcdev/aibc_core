# Google Analytics API Cost Analysis

## Cost Summary: **FREE** ✅

**Google Analytics Reporting API v4 is completely FREE** - there are no charges for using it.

### Key Points:

1. **No API Costs**: The Google Analytics Reporting API v4 has no per-request charges
2. **Free Quota Limits**:
   - **100,000 requests per day** per project
   - **10 requests per second** per IP address
   - **50 requests per 100 seconds** per user

3. **Your Usage (5-10 requests/day)**:
   - Well within free tier (0.01% of daily quota)
   - No cost implications whatsoever
   - No need for Google Cloud credits

4. **Google Cloud Credits**:
   - **Cannot be used** for Google Analytics API (it's already free)
   - Credits apply to other Google Cloud services (Compute, Storage, etc.)
   - Since GA API is free, there's nothing to offset

### Implementation Notes:

- **OAuth Setup Required**: You'll need to set up OAuth 2.0 authentication (free)
- **API Key**: Free to obtain from Google Cloud Console
- **Rate Limiting**: Your 5-10 requests/day are well below limits
- **Data Access**: Free access to Analytics data via API

### Recommendation:

✅ **Proceed with Google Analytics integration** - it's completely free for your use case.

The only "cost" is development time to:
1. Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication
2. Implement API calls
3. Build data visualization

No ongoing API costs whatsoever.
